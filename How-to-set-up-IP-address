How to set up IP Address on a VM in Linux

Setting up an IP address on a virtual machine (VM) in Linux involves a few simple steps. I'll provide a general guide that should work for most Linux distributions. 
Keep in mind that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the distribution and the network configuration you are using.
Open a terminal: Access your Linux VM either through a graphical interface or a remote connection using SSH.
Check network interfaces: Use the following command to list the available network interfaces on your VM:

  $ ifconfig -a
  $ ip addr show

The primary network interface is often named "eth0" or "ensXX" (where XX is a number).
Edit network configuration file: You will need root privileges to modify the network configuration. Use a text editor (such as nano or vi) to edit the network configuration file. 
The file location and name may differ depending on your Linux distribution:

For systems that use ifconfig:
  $ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

For systems that use ip (such as recent versions of Ubuntu and CentOS):
  $ sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

Configure the IP address: Inside the network configuration file, locate the line related to the interface you want to configure (e.g., eth0). 
Modify the file to set a static IP address. 
The syntax may vary slightly between different Linux distributions.

For ifconfig, set a static IP address:
 $ iface eth0 inet static

  address YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
  netmask YOUR_NETMASK
  gateway YOUR_GATEWAY

For ip, set a static IP address:

makefile
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
NETMASK=YOUR_NETMASK
GATEWAY=YOUR_GATEWAY
ONBOOT=yes

Replace YOUR_IP_ADDRESS, YOUR_NETMASK, and YOUR_GATEWAY with the appropriate values for your network. Save the changes and exit the text editor.
Restart the network service: After making changes to the network configuration, restart the network service for the changes to take effect. 
The command may vary depending on your Linux distribution.

For systems that use ifconfig:
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

For systems that use ip (such as recent versions of Ubuntu and CentOS):
  $ sudo systemctl restart network

Verify the IP address: Use the following command to check if the IP address is set correctly:
  $ ifconfig
  $ ip addr show

You should now see the configured IP address associated with the network interface you modified.

Please note that if you're using a VM provider or virtualization software, there might be additional settings to configure within the VM management interface to ensure 
network connectivity to the outside world (e.g., NAT, bridged networking, etc.).
